# Machine Learning 2023 Spring

Welcome to my Machine Learning Learning repository! This repository is designed to help me learn the fundamentals of machine learning and build my skills in this exciting field. It includes my course notes, personal projects, and other resources to help me master machine learning.

## Introduction

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to transform industries and society as a whole. From self-driving cars to personalized healthcare, machine learning is behind many of the most exciting developments in technology today.

This repository is a place for me to document my journey as I learn machine learning. It includes my notes and personal projects to help me practice what I'm learning. Whether I'm a complete beginner or an experienced programmer, I'll find resources here that will help me build my knowledge and skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, I'll need to have some basic programming knowledge and an interest in machine learning. I can review some introductory resources, such as:

- [Dive into Deep Learning](https://zh.d2l.ai) by Mu Li et al.

Once I have some basic knowledge, I can start exploring the resources in this repository. I've organized the repository into different topics, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. Each topic has a set of resources, including tutorials, sample code, and personal projects, that will help me build my knowledge and skills.

## Resources

This repository contains a variety of resources to help me learn machine learning, including:

- Course Notes: Comprehensive notes for each class session that summarize the key concepts and provide examples and code snippets.
- Personal Projects: Coding projects that help me practice what I learn and build my skills.
- Tutorials: Step-by-step guides that walk me through the process of building a machine learning model.
- Sample Code: Examples of machine learning code that I can use as a starting point for my own projects.
- Datasets: Collections of data that I can use to train my machine learning models.

I'm constantly updating this repository with new resources and personal projects, so be sure to check back often!
